Notes:
- Console logs will let you know the actions being performed in script
- Script first call step1 API to fetch data and write CSV. This is repeated for each page and CSV is updated. 
- Once step1 is completed, it fetch step3 API data and create CSV. 
- Step 1 returns more than 1 Million records. This means step 2 will take time to complete. 
- In order to improve performance of step2, multithreading is used. It will start threads based on number of logical processors of PC
- Each thread of step2 will create its separate CSV file which will be merged once all data is fetched.
